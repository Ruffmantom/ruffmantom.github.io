                    <p>My name is Tom Ruff, this is my portfolio. I am currently a full-time student at the U of U learning full-stack web development. This site is actually a project that I am working on at the moment and need to finish before Saturday the 16th. I moved to Utah about 2 years ago now and have been working as a graphic designer for a sign company. Right now I have committed to being a full-time student so I can fully immerse myself into learning this material. I have a certificate in front end web development from CodeCademy back in 2018 but wanted to take my learning to a much bigger scale. I have a huge passion for building sites and learning about front and back end development. It is super fun and exciting when you learn something new and are able to implement it to your project. I am super excited to get more in-depth with back-end web development since that it was pretty tuff for me when I was taking the CodeCademy course. Some little things about me, I grew up in Illinois, started skateboarding since I was 2 years old and love all outdoors stuff and the casual video games. Ever since moving to Utah I have started to mountain bike and will be snowboarding a ton this year at snowbird. I love to build things mostly with wood but also like to weld and make gifts for friends. Thank you to whoever has read this and hope this gave you a little picture of who I am and what I like to do. </p>
