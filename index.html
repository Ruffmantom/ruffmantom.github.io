                    <p>My name is Tom Ruff, this is my portfolio. I am currently a full-time student at the U of U learning web development. This site is actually a project that I am working on at the moment and need to finish before Saturday the 16th. Right now I am writing you this so that I can have subtext about myself and include funny attributes. I am currently watching  The Office when Mr. Scott made a movie called Threat Level Midnight. I am currently at the scene where Andy is the bartender and makes Michael do the Scarn. Some things about me, in my free time I like to skateboard, hang out with my wife, mountain bike, build stuff, hike, camp, utv, videogame, edit and record video, help people, and many other good and fun things.
